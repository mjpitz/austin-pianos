# Austin Pianos

There's ton of threads that pop up on [Reddit][], so I figured I'd capture some of the ones that I've visited and played
into a single location. Some images I pulled from the interwebs for the time being, but I plan on updating them as I get
around to playing them all. I'm sure there's more so if you know of them or have photos, don't hesitate to contribute.

I'm pretty sure this location has two pianos. There's the clear grand from Lucid, and then I saw a black baby
grand walking by there the other day. Wanted to go in to check them out but was too nervous.
